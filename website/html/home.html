    Transit Data NYC hosts a dataset of train arrival times for New York City subway, starting March 15, 2021.
    For each trip that ran in the subway,
    the dataset contains the list of stations the trip stopped at and the times it
    arrived.
    The dataset is updated every morning at around 6am with data from the previous day.
