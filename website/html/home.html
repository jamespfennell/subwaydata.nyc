    Subway Data NYC hosts a growing dataset of train arrival times for the New York City subway starting March 15, 2021.
    For each trip that runs in the subway,
    the dataset contains the list of stations the trip stopped at and the times it arrived.
    The dataset is updated every morning at around 6am with data from the previous day.

    The dataset is built using the <a href="https://api.mta.info">GTFS Realtime data published by the MTA</a>.
    The <a href="/how-it-worls">how it works page</a> describes the process in detail.
    All of the <a href="https://github.com/jamespfennell/subwaydata.nyc">software</a> used 
        (including this website) is open source and adaptable for other transit systems.
